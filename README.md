Spotify Customization from Spicetify
From this guy on github:https://github.com/boudywho/spicetify-arch-installation-guide 
// I have noticed that if you use Arch, the AUR packages will open *slightly faster than flatpak. (*obervation)

//As of now, I am still in a confused state to completely switch to Linux. Its fun but complatibility issues are still there, especially for NVIDIA. I hope it will be solved.

// I have made some minor changes to keybindings, these are somewhat similar to windows. 
** I had fun using hyprland.
